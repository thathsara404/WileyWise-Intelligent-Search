    <h1>Renewable Energy Benefits</h1>
    <p>
        Renewable energy sources are crucial for a sustainable future. Wind and solar energy are two of the most
        prominent renewable energy sources. They are not only affordable but also help significantly in reducing
        carbon emissions. Governments and organizations worldwide are investing in renewable energy technologies
        to combat climate change and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.

        The adoption of renewable energy contributes to cleaner air, healthier ecosystems, and a more stable climate.
        However, challenges such as energy storage and initial investment costs need to be addressed to maximize the
        potential of these resources.
