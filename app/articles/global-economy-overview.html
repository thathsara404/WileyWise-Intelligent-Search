            <h2>How Economies Grow</h2>
            <p>
                Economic growth occurs when there is an increase in the production of goods and services over a period of
                time. Factors driving growth include technological advancements, capital investment, workforce education,
                and sound economic policies. However, growth must be sustainable to avoid inflation and environmental
                degradation.
