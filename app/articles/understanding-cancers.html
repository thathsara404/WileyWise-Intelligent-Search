            <h2>What is Cancer?</h2>
            <p>
                Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. 
                If the spread is not controlled, it can result in death. Cancer can develop in almost any tissue or 
                organ in the body.
