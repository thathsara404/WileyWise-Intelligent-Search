    <h1>Sustainable Agriculture</h1>
    <p>
        Sustainable agriculture is an approach to farming that balances the need for food production with the
        preservation of environmental quality. By focusing on long-term productivity, sustainable agriculture
        incorporates practices such as crop rotation, conservation tillage, and organic farming.
    </p>
    <p>
        These methods aim to minimize the environmental impact of farming while maintaining soil health,
        conserving water, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Farmers practicing sustainable agriculture often
        prioritize biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and social responsibility.
